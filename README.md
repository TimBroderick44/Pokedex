<h1 style="font-weight: 900"> Pokedex (Practising Using APIs) </h1>

We were challenged to use an API and create a small app. I'm a massive nerd so here is the result: a pokedex.

## What did I use to create it?

This project uses:

-   HTML
-   SCSS
-   JS

## Features of the Project:

-   User can search for the name of a pokemon (e.g. "Charizard") and have a picture of it and their in-game call (voice? sound?) played for them.
-   If no name is present, clicking 'Find That Pokemon' will show a random Pokemon for the user.

## Resizing elements dependant on the data recieved.

-   There are pokemon with really short names and pokemon with insanely long names, so I had to be able to adjust the font size on the fly so that it could fit within the pane of the Pokedex. With help from my coaches, I was able to find a solution to the problem (basically taking the length of the text returned and applying some math to it).

## What I want to include in the future:

## Have more functionality:

-   [ ] I want to be have more data shown (e.g. Stats, weight, etc.)
-   [ ] I want to be able to show the move pools of pokemon. 
-   [ ] Allow users to see the shiny forms / animations of the pokemon
-   [ ] Have users be able to search based on different criteria (name, weight, etc.)
-   [ ] Have users create 'mock teams' to build. 

## Thank You!

Thank you for taking the time to look at this project. I really hope you enjoy it.
Feel free to reach out and ask any questions.
